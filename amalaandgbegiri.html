    <h2>Ingredients for Gbegiri</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Beans (preferably brown or black-eyed peas)</li>
        <li>Seasoning cubes (like Maggi)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Optional: Palm oil, pepper, and onions for flavoring</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions for Gbegiri</h2>
    <p>1. **Prepare the Beans**: Rinse the beans thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt. Place the beans in a pot and cover them with water.</p>
    <p>2. **Cook the Beans**: Bring the pot to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and let it simmer until the beans are soft (about 30-45 minutes). Add salt and seasoning cubes to taste.</p>
    <p>3. **Blend the Beans**: Once the beans are cooked and soft, drain excess water (if any) and allow them to cool slightly. Use a blender or a mortar and pestle to blend the beans until smooth. You can add a little water if needed to achieve a smooth consistency.</p>
    <p>4. **Cook the Gbegiri**: Pour the blended beans back into the pot. Add water gradually until you reach your desired consistency (it can be thick or a bit watery, depending on preference). Stir continuously over low heat until well combined and heated through. You can also add palm oil, chopped onions, and pepper for additional flavor at this stage. Cook for another 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Amala</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Amala flour (or yam flour)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions for Amala</h2>
    <p>1. **Prepare the Water**: In a separate pot, bring water to a boil to prepare the Amala.</p>
    <p>2. **Add the Amala Flour**: Gradually add the Amala flour to the boiling water, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.</p>
    <p>3. **Cook the Amala**: Cook the Amala for a few minutes, stirring until it is smooth and stretchy. Ensure there are no lumps. You may need to add more water if it becomes too thick.</p>
    <p>4. **Serve**: Serve the Amala hot with the Gbegiri on the side.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients for Ewedu</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh Ewedu leaves (or Jute leaves)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Seasoning cubes (like Maggi)</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>Optional: Locust beans (iru) for flavor</li>
        <li>Optional: Ground crayfish for extra taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions for Ewedu</h2>
    <p>1. **Prepare the Ewedu Leaves**: Rinse the fresh Ewedu leaves thoroughly to remove dirt and impurities. Remove the stalks and chop the leaves coarsely.</p>
    <p>2. **Cook the Ewedu**: Place the chopped Ewedu leaves in a pot with some water. Cook over medium heat for about 10-15 minutes until they become soft and slimy.</p>
    <p>3. **Blend (Optional)**: You can blend the Ewedu for a smoother texture, but it is traditionally left unblended. If blending, add a little water to facilitate the blending process.</p>
    <p>4. **Season the Ewedu**: Add seasoning cubes, salt, locust beans, and ground crayfish (if using) to the pot. Stir well and let it simmer for another 5 minutes to combine the flavors.</p>
    <p>5. **Serve**: Serve the Ewedu hot alongside Amala and Gbegiri.</p>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Enjoy your Amala and Gbegiri with Ewedu as a hearty and nutritious meal!</p>
